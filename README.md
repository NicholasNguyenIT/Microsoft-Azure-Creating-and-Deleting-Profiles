Here I show skills in Azure on how to create a profile and how to delete it.

Starting off, you want to go to all users. You will see yourself there, then click on **+ New User**.

Afterward, it will prompt you to give a principal name and then a display name with an option to change the display name and whether or not to give the user an auto-generated password or their own.

You can go to **Assignments**, add this user to a group, and assign the user a role. Here, I chose "Application Developer," and within the **Properties** tab, you can put employee information.

Now you are finished creating a user profile with or without privileges!

To delete the user, simply select the box by their name and select **Delete**. The user does not permanently delete for 30 days.
